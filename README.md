## 🧪 Inputs Used for Prediction

The app uses the following 13 features from the [Cleveland Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease):

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| age | Age of the patient |
| sex | Gender (1 = male, 0 = female) |
| cp | Chest pain type (0–3) |
| trestbps | Resting blood pressure |
| chol | Serum cholesterol |
| fbs | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl |
| restecg | Resting electrocardiographic results |
| thalach | Max heart rate achieved |
| exang | Exercise-induced angina |
| oldpeak | ST depression |
| slope | Slope of the ST segment |
| ca | Major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy |
| thal | Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect) |
